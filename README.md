# Miscellaneous coding projects

## index_trader:
My first python project. This is a solution to a puzzle found at modularfinance.se.
The task is to write a program that finds the best dates (and prices) to buy and
sell indexes to optimize the return. Only one buy and sell is allowed. Short
selling not allowed.
